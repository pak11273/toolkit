## Image Opimizations

#### Scale image down
Image sizes for full-width slideshows
For full-width slideshows (that automatically stretch to the full size of the browser), I recommend going for 2560 pixels in width, which is the standard resolution width for 27″ and 30″ monitors.

#### Compression 60-70%
Exporting & compressing JPG images
Regardless of the photo editing software that you’re using, you almost never need to export images at 100% (in the quality slider). Choosing something like 60 or 70 gives you good-enough quality for much smaller file sizes (sometimes you can see a 5:1 reduction in file size without any perceived quality loss).
