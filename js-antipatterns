• Polluting the global namespace by defining a large number of variables in the global
context
• Passing strings rather than functions to either setTimeout or setInterval as this
triggers the use of eval() internally.
• Modifying the Object class prototype (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)
• Using JavaScript in an inline form as this is inflexible
• The use of document.write where native DOM alternatives such as document.createElement
are more appropriate. document.write has been grossly misused over
the years and has quite a few disadvantages including that if it's executed after the
page has been loaded it can actually overwrite the page you're on, whilst document.
createElement does not. You can see here for a live example of this in action.
It also doesn't work with XHTML which is another reason opting for more DOMfriendly
methods such as document.createElement is favorable.
